## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Run `{{DIFF_SPEC}}` to see the changes being reviewed.
2. Check the repo root for project instruction files (GEMINI.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, COPILOT.md, .cursorrules, or similar). Read any that exist for project conventions and coding standards.
3. Read the FULL contents of each changed file (not just the diff hunks) to understand surrounding context.
4. For new imports, function calls, or type references in the diff, read the referenced files to understand interfaces and contracts.
5. Check if tests exist for the changed code. Read them to assess coverage.
6. Look for related configuration, type definitions, or documentation if relevant.

### Step 2: Review

For each issue found, provide:
- **Severity**: critical / warning / suggestion
- **File**: the file path
- **Line**: approximate line number
- **Issue**: clear description
- **Suggestion**: how to fix it

Focus on:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Missing error handling
- Whether tests adequately cover the changes
- Consistency with patterns in surrounding code and project conventions

## Response Length

Keep the review concise. Focus on significant findings, not line-by-line commentary. Group related issues together. If the code looks good, say so briefly. Don't invent issues.
